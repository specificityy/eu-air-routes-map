<hr>

In order to run it you need to have <a href='http://nodejs.org/download/'>NPM</a> installed.

Then download the source code.

Open a command window and navigate to the project's directory.

In case you don't have <a href='http://gruntjs.com/'>Grunt</a> installed, run this command first ```npm install -g grunt-cli```

Then enter ```npm install``` from the command line.

And enter this command ```grunt``` to run the server. 

That should open the app in your default browser.
